# KNN K-Nearest-Neighbour-Classifier

KNN is a simple, supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks — and is also frequently used in missing value imputation.

It is based on the idea that the observations closest to a given data point are the most “similar” observations in a data set, and we can therefore classify unforeseen points based on the values of the closest existing points. 
By choosing K, the user can select the number of nearby observations to use in the algorithm.


# Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

Id
SepalLengthCm
SepalWidthCm
PetalLengthCm
PetalWidthCm
Target
Flower_name
